# AGENTS.md — review agent guidelines (host-agnostic)

## Plugin architecture

This plugin implements a single principle:

> **The partner reviews, never the host.**

For every review (plan, code, prompt, or routed-to via `review-all`):

- The agent reading the SKILL.md is the **host**.
- The host **must not** review the host's own work.
- The host runs `lib/call-external.sh` to delegate the heavy critique to the
  OTHER agent (the **partner**).
- The host then runs its own independent analysis and **cross-validates**
  against the partner's output, tagging findings as `[cross-validated]`,
  `[external-only]`, or `[host-only]`.

There is **no haiku courier subagent** in this version. The host (main
session) does both the external dispatch and the synthesis. Removed in the
0.5.0 refactor — the courier added complexity (model inconsistency across
files, blocking-vs-non-blocking ambiguity) without proportionate value.

## Cross-host routing

| Detected host | Partner                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `claude`      | Codex (`codex exec --sandbox read-only`) |
| `codex`       | Claude (`claude -p --model opus --effort xhigh`) |
| `unknown`     | (skip primary; try Gemini cascade)   |

Detection happens at every invocation via `lib/detect-host.sh`. See
`references/host-detection.md` for the priority order and the env-leak
asymmetry that drives "Codex env first, Claude env second".

## Anti-recursion contract

`lib/call-external.sh` reads `ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_DEPTH` (default `0`). If
it sees `≥ 1`, it refuses with exit `1`. Before invoking the partner, it
sets `ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW_DEPTH=1` in the partner's env. So if a launched
partner ever re-triggers this skill, the guard fires. Never disable.

## Output integrity (for synthesis by the host)

Every finding in the final output MUST include:

1. **Severity** — P0 (critical) / P1 (high) / P2 (medium) / P3 (low)
2. **Evidence** — direct quote, file:line reference, or concrete scenario
3. **Recommendation** — specific, actionable fix
4. **Origin tag** — `[cross-validated]` / `[external-only]` / `[host-only]`
   (from the cross-validation step)

## Severity scale

| Level | Meaning                                                | Action                       |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| P0    | Critical — exploitable, data loss, security breach     | Must fix before merge/deploy |
| P1    | High — significant risk, likely failure mode           | Should fix in this iteration |
| P2    | Medium — quality issue, minor risk                     | Fix when convenient          |
| P3    | Low — style, minor optimization                        | Optional improvement         |

## Fallback chain

See `references/fallback-chain.md`. Order: primary partner → Gemini cascade
→ DEGRADED. **The DEGRADED mode emits an explicit banner** in stdout and
returns exit 2 from `call-external.sh` so the SKILL knows to surface it to
the user.

## Honesty rules

- When a review is clean, say so. Do not manufacture findings.
- When uncertain about severity, use confidence tags.
- When input is ambiguous, ask — don't guess.
- When degraded mode triggers, **always show the banner**. Silent self-review
  is the failure mode this plugin was designed to prevent.

## What this plugin does NOT cover

- **Live multi-turn dialog with the partner.** The call is one-shot:
  prompt in, analysis out. If you need iteration, the host asks the user;
  the user asks the partner directly via the partner's interactive UI.
- **Approval workflows.** This plugin produces critiques, not approvals.
  Merge / ship decisions remain the user's.
- **State persistence across calls.** Each `lib/call-external.sh` invocation
  is independent. State that needs to persist lives in host memory
  (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/memory/` or `~/.codex/memories/`).
